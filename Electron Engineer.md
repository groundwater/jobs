# Electron Team Engineer

We want Electron to be the best option for building desktop apps.

GitHub is looking for a software developer to work on the 100% open source Electron project. Electron is a community and open source project that makes it possible for developers to leverage web development skills to build desktop applications.

Electron already powers many of the apps you may use today, including [the Atom Editor](https://atom.io/), the Slack Desktop Client, Visual Studio Code, and [many more](http://electron.atom.io/apps/).

**Your work is open, and every line of code you write can benefit millions of users.**

Our main projects are [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron),
[brightray](https://github.com/electron/brightray),
[electron.atom.io](https://github.com/electron/electron.atom.io),
and [libchromiumcontent](https://github.com/electron/libchromiumcontent).
We also sometimes work with other projects in [github.com/electron](https://github.com/electron),
and [github.com/electron-userland](https://github.com/electron-userland).

## Team Goals

Our teams goal is to make Electron the best option for building desktop applications, whether you are:

- a student developing apps in their spare time
- a bootcamp graduate looking to start a new project
- a software startup, looking for a platform to build their application
- a company looking to distribute a first-class desktop application to millions
- an enterprise company looking to distribute an internal application to thousands of employees

## Thing we have accomplished so far

- we released [Electron 1.0](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/05/11/electron-1-0), giving thousands of developers a stable platform upon which to build their software products
- we [organized the docs](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/09/27/api-docs-json-schema)
  to enable TypeScript definitions and IDE autocompletion, giving new developers a gentler introduction to a complex ecosystem
- we [improved accessibility](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/08/23/accessibility-tools), letting developers build more inclusive applications
- we provided [pre-build distributions](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/08/16/npm-install-electron)
  to make it easier for new developers to distribute first time apps
- we maintain an up-to-date core experience,
  by pulling in the latest [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) releases,
  giving developers access to the latest in web performance and features

## Essentials for Success
