# Electron Team Engineer

We want Electron to be the best option for building best-in-class desktop apps.

GitHub is looking for a software developer to work on the Electron project. Electron is a community and open source project that makes it possible for developers to leverage web development skills to build desktop applications.

## Team Goals

Our teams goal is to make Electron the best option for building desktop applications, whether you are:

- a student developing apps in their spare time
- a bootcamp graduate looking to start a new project
- a software startup, looking for a platform to build their application
- a company looking to distribute a first-class desktop application to millions
- an enterprise company looking to distribute an internal application to thousands of employees

## Thing we have accomplished so far

- we released [Electron 1.0](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/05/11/electron-1-0), giving thousands of developers a stable platform upon which to build their software products
- we [organized the docs](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/09/27/api-docs-json-schema)
  to enable TypeScript definitions and IDE autocompletion, giving new developers a gentler introduction to a complex ecosystem
- we [improved accessibility](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/08/23/accessibility-tools), letting developers build more inclusive applications
- we provided [pre-build distributions](http://electron.atom.io/blog/2016/08/16/npm-install-electron)
  to make it easier for new developers to distribute first time apps
- we maintain an up to date core experience,
  by pulling in the latest [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) releases,
  giving developers access to the latest in web performance and features
